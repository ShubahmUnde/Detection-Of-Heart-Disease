Heart Disease Project Description
   Columns 14 
#Age -   age in years
# Sex -  (1 = male; 0 = female)
# Cp  -  chest pain type
# trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
# Chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
# fbs -  (fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
# restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
# thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
# Exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
# Target - yes or NO
# Oldpeak - >ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
so from prediction we get which factors area strongly releted or reasons for heart disease.
